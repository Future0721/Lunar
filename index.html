        <h2>About the Moon</h2>
        <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. Its diameter is about one-quarter of Earth's (comparable to the
            width of Australia),[17] making it the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System and the largest and most
            massive relative to its parent planet. It is larger than all known dwarf planets in the Solar System.[18]
            The Moon is a planetary-mass object with a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the
            geophysical definitions of the term. It lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field.
            Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's at 0.1654 gâ€”Jupiter's moon Io is the only satellite in the
            Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.</p>

        <h2>The Moon and its Lunar phases</h2>
        <p>What does Moon lunar phases means ?<br>
            Some nights, the Moon might look like a narrow crescent. Other nights, the Moon might look like a bright
            circle. And on other nights, you might not be able to see the Moon at all. The different shapes of the Moon
            that we see at different times of the month are called the Moon's phases.</p>
